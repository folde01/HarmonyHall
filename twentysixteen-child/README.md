# Website for the Save Harmony Hall campaign 

This repo contains the custom WordPress files for the website (under development as of 15 Dec 2019) of the Save Harmony Hall campaign.

Save Harmony Hall is a group of residents in my local area who are campaigning to prevent the closure of Harmony Hall, a community centre in Truro Road, London E17. 

I started designing and building the site in November 2019 after approaching the campaign to offer my help and then meeting with its leaders to gather requirements. I aim to launch it in early 2020.  

The files here comprise a child theme of the twentysixteen theme. Further customisations have been made by adding custom CSS through the twentysixteen theme, itself.

Please get in touch if you would like to see a development version of the website.
